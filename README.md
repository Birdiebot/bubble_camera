# Bubble camera
This package mainly maintains the SDK for the image input device in the [Bubble](https://github.com/Birdiebot/bubble) project. This package provides three image input methods: V4L, Daheng Industrial Camera, Hik-Robot Industrial Camera. You can use these drivers by switching between different branches. In the `main` branch, we maintain access to image data via V4L, which means you can quickly test you project on different platforms with USB cables or existing video.

As you can see due to time constraints, the different input methods are not derived via OOP, and the project currently maintains different SDK via branches. In the future, we may refactor this feature pack.

This project is a part of Bubble. For more information on the project, please visit [Bubble-RoboMaster visual software stack based on ROS2](https://github.com/Birdiebot/bubble).
